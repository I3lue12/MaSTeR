<p>A common use of the onmouseover and onmouseout event handlers is
to change the button image displayed for a navigational link on a Web
page. For example, holding your mouse over an image of a Home button
(that jumps to the Web site’s home page) could replace the image
with one that is more vivid in order to clearly identify the page that
is the target of the link. Your Projects folder for Chapter 4 contains eight images, home1.gif, home2.gif, faq1.gif, faq2.gif, guestbook1.gif,
guestbook2.gif, join1.gif, and join2.gif, which represent typical navigational
buttons you will find on a Web site. The second version of each
button is slightly more vivid than the first version.<li> Create a Web page
that displays the first version of each button as image links, using the
<a> element.</li><li> Holding your mouse over each image should display
the more vivid version of the image, while moving your mouse off
the image should display the less vivid version.</li><li> Do not worry about
actually creating a Web page as the target of each link; just assign an
empty string to each <a> element’s href attribute.</li><li> Save the document
as Buttons.html.</li></p>
