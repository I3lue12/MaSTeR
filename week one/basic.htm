		The Basic Stick
		</h2>
		<p>
			The Basic Stick is the perfect stick rotates slowly to provide extra
			time for performing stick tricks, but is flashy enough to impress your friends.
			Enjoy the folowing:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
			<p>
			<b>Patented Dura-Coat&reg</b> finish ensures sticks can withstand all weather conditions. More 
			durable than other sticks, these props will keep looking like new for as long as you own 
			them.
			</p>
			<p>	
			<b>Enhanced stick flexibility</b> provides more bounce, allowing for better tricks. A soft rubber 
			core adds a whole new element to the sticking experience that you have to feel to believe!
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>Full customization</b> will give you the chance to own a pair of sticks unlike any others out 
			there. I make exactly what you want, with your colors and your designs.
			</p>
			<p>
			<b>A personal touch</b> through both my customization options and hand-crafted designs.
